In this folder, we contribute three traffic sign classification datasets used in our study: Coming Soon

The datasets have the same 128Ã—128 formats:
* The first one is extracted from the famous German Traffic Sign Recognition Dataset (GTSRB). [Original Link](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/index.php?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset)
* The second one is extracted from an Indian traffic sign recognition dataset. [Original Link](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/indian-cautionary-traffic-sign-data-set)
* The third one is extracted from a Chinese traffic sign recognition dataset. [Original Link](https://github.com/csust7zhangjm/CCTSDB)

The size and class for each dataset used in our study are as follows:

|  Dataset   | Classes  | Training Set |  Validation Set | Testing Set | Google Drive | Baidu Yun|
|  ----  | ----  | ----  | ----  | ----  | ----  | ----  |
| German | 43 | 31,367 | 7,842 | 12,630 | Link | Link (password: ) |
